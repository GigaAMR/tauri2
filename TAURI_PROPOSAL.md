# Tauri proposal

I am writing this proposal to ask if we can introduce a `specta` feature to the `tauri` crate.

This feature will contain an implementation of [specta::functions::FunctionArg](https://docs.rs/specta/2.0.0-rc.8/specta/functions/trait.FunctionArg.html) for [`tauri::State`](https://docs.rs/tauri/latest/tauri/struct.State.html), [`tauri::window::Window`](https://docs.rs/tauri/latest/tauri/window/struct.Window.html) and [`tauri::AppHandle`](https://docs.rs/tauri/latest/tauri/struct.AppHandle.html).

This feature would significantly help with supporting [Tauri Specta](https://github.com/oscartbeaumont/tauri-specta).

## What is Tauri Specta?

Tauri Specta is a crate which combines [Specta](https://docs.rs/specta/latest/specta/)'s Typescript, Javascript and JSDoc exporters with your Tauri commands for end-to-end type safety.

To use it you add the [`specta::specta`](https://docs.rs/specta/2.0.0-rc.8/specta/attr.specta.html) macro to your commands like the following:
```rs
#[tauri::command]
#[specta::specta] // < dis bit
fn my_command() {}
```

Then you use the [`tauri_specta::collect_commands`](https://docs.rs/tauri-specta/2.0.0-rc.4/tauri_specta/macro.collect_commands.html) to collect the types and Tauri commands and attach them to the Tauri builder.

The macro's all work exactly the same as the Tauri equivalents but if your still unsure checkout [this example app](https://github.com/oscartbeaumont/tauri-specta/tree/main/examples/app).

## Why not `tauri-bingen`?

[tauri-bindgen](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri-bindgen) is a really cool crate for doing a similar thing.

However it takes the schema first approach, as opposed to Tauri Specta's code-first approach.

Tauri bindgen uses `.wit` files as the source of truth for the types in Rust and, as opposed to your Rust code. Both approaches have their place but I personally prefer the easy of use of not needing to maintain `.wit` files.

## Why not a `tauri` feature on Specta?

Up until the [`2.0.0-rc.8` release of Specta](https://github.com/oscartbeaumont/specta/releases/tag/v2.0.0-rc.8) (release earlier today) we supported Tauri however this isn't going to be possible after Specta v2 moves to a stable release.

### You major, we major

If we depend on Tauri every time Tauri releases a major version so would Specta.

This is a big problem when I would like Specta v2 to the final version.

Similar to Serde, I want Specta to be able to develop an ecosystem of crates than implement it's trait and for this to happen Specta's API surface needs to be locked because us releasing a major is a big deal.

### Just use features?

A common approach in the ecosystem is to use features to work around this.

For example if/when Tauri v3 comes out we could add a `tauri3` feature to Specta.

However this won't work. Tauri depends on C/C++ libraries such as WebKit which link against shared libraries and Cargo isn't smart enough to handle this when features are used.

If `tauri` appears twice in the same *Cargo workspace* you will get the following error:

```
error: failed to select a version for `webkit2gtk-sys`.
    ... required by package `webkit2gtk v2.0.1`
    ... which satisfies dependency `webkit2gtk = "=2.0.1"` of package `tauri v2.0.0-beta.13`
    ... which satisfies dependency `tauri2 = "=2.0.0-beta.13"` of package `testing v0.1.0 (/Users/oscar/Desktop/testing)`
versions that meet the requirements `^2.0.1` are: 2.0.1

the package `webkit2gtk-sys` links to the native library `web_kit2`, but it conflicts with a previous package which links to `web_kit2` as well:
package `webkit2gtk-sys v0.18.0`
    ... which satisfies dependency `ffi = "^0.18"` of package `webkit2gtk v0.18.2`
    ... which satisfies dependency `webkit2gtk = "^0.18.2"` of package `tauri v1.6.1`
    ... which satisfies dependency `tauri = "=1.6.1"` of package `testing v0.1.0 (/Users/oscar/Desktop/testing)`
Only one package in the dependency graph may specify the same links value. This helps ensure that only one copy of a native library is linked in the final binary. Try to adjust your dependencies so that only one package uses the `links = "web_kit2"` value. For more information, see https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/resolver.html#links.

failed to select a version for `webkit2gtk-sys` which could resolve this conflict
```

Cargo's resolver seems to account for the `links` property in the `Cargo.toml` prior without taking into account the enabled features.

  ```sh
    cargo new testing
    cd testing/
    echo "tauri = { version = \"=1.6.1\", optional = true }" >> Cargo.toml
    echo "tauri2 = { package = \"tauri\", version = \"=2.0.0-beta.13\", optional = true }" >> Cargo.toml
    cargo run # < We don't provide `--features` so neither are enabled.
  ```

### Okay so have another crate?

Another common approach in the ecosystem is to use crates for integrations.

For example [`rspc`](https://github.com/oscartbeaumont/rspc) another project of mine is doing exactly this. We have the core [`rspc`](https://docs.rs/tauri) crate and an [`rspc_tauri`](https://docs.rs/rspc-tauri) crate.

Now this runs into the same issues where multiple Tauri version cant exist in the same Cargo workspace but that can be worked around by having a second GitHub repository as rspc has done for [`rspc_tauri2`](https://github.com/specta-rs/tauri2/tree/main/rspc_tauri2).

This however won't work for Specta as we will run into Rust's [Orphan Rule](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items/implementations.html#orphan-rules). With the Orphan rule the implementation can with the `specta` trait or the `tauri` trait and we have discussed above why Specta is not viable.

## What would the implementations look like?

```rs
use specta::{TypeMap, DataType, functions::FunctionArg};

impl<'r, T: Send + Sync + 'static> FunctionArg for tauri::State {
    fn to_datatype(type_map: &mut TypeMap) -> Option<DataType> {
        None
    }
}

impl<R: tauri::Runtime> FunctionArg for tauri::AppHandle<R> {
    fn to_datatype(type_map: &mut TypeMap) -> Option<DataType> {
        None
    }
}

impl<R: tauri::Runtime> FunctionArg for tauri::Window {
    fn to_datatype(type_map: &mut TypeMap) -> Option<DataType> {
        None
    }
}
```

## Specta v2 is in beta

Right now Specta v2 is being released under `2.0.0-rc.x` releases. I am not 100% sure that the current API surface will not need breaking changes and i'm not going to be doing the full release until i'm dead sure this can be the last major Specta release.

However, even though this is the case I think it's safe for Tauri to implement a Specta feature right now.

## Semver and caret

If Tauri were to depend on Specta version `^2.0.0-rc.8` it will match all future release candidates and the final release.

As long as Specta maintains the following guarantees, Tauri will be able to maintain semver:

 - `specta::TypeMap` exists, no restrictions on it's API surface.
 - `specta::DataType` exists, no restrictions on it's API surface.
 - `specta::functions::FunctionArg` exists, and must not change it's trait definition.

All these are things I can guarantee.

<details>
  <summary>Sanity check using semver crate</summary>
  
  The following parses with the [`semver`](https://docs.rs/semver) crate which documents itself as using "Cargoâ€™s flavor of Semantic Versioning".

  ```rs
use semver::{Version, VersionReq};

fn main() {
    let req = VersionReq::parse("^2.0.0-rc.8").unwrap();
    assert!(req.matches(&Version::parse("2.0.0-rc.9").unwrap()));
    assert!(req.matches(&Version::parse("2.0.0").unwrap()));
    assert!(req.matches(&Version::parse("2.1.0").unwrap()));
}
  ```
</details>

## Alternatives

### Move Specta function related code into Tauri Specta

We could copy all of the macro and traits related to functions from Specta to within Tauri Specta. This would make the Tauri Specta significantly harder to maintain.

Right now Tauri Specta leaves all the heavy lifting to Specta and just exists to remove the boilerplate.
